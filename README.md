## 📰 Example Summary

**Article URL:** [Mission Request: Superchain Track at Crecimiento Hackathon](https://gov.optimism.io/t/mission-request-superchain-track-at-crecimiento-hackathon/9191)

### Summary:

A proposal is requesting **36,500 OP** to sponsor the **Crecimiento Pop-Up City hackathon** in **Buenos Aires** this December. This hackathon is part of a larger Web3 movement aiming to connect **startups, investors, and developers**. The goal is to introduce developers to the **OP Superchain** through sponsorship, promotional efforts, and direct engagement.

Success will be measured by **event execution, brand exposure, and developer involvement**. However, since **Season 6** of the grant program is closed, the proposal suggests revisiting it for **Season 7**, starting **January 16th**, after the release of **Season 7 intents** (expected post **November 20th**).
